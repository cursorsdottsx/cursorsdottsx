### Hi, I am \[Cursors\]

I like to make useless things with crappy code.

Right now I'm making [The Archive](https://github.com/im-lonely/the-archive-bot) even crappier with more crappy code.

I'm presently pursuing backend to be a fullstack developer.ðŸ’»

Collaboration is great, I'm always available!

I don't need help with anything though, Stack Overflow seems just fine.ðŸ˜ƒ

Pronouns:
- It/Its/It's

Ah well, see you later! ðŸ‘‹
