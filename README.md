### Hi, I am \[Cursors\]

I like to make useless things with crappy code.

I like editing images in my free time.

I like being repetitive.

Right now I'm making nothing and being useless :D

I'm presently pursuing backend to be a fullstack developer.ðŸ’»

Collaboration is great, I'm always available!

I don't need help with anything though, Stack Overflow seems just fine.ðŸ˜ƒ

Pronouns:
- It
- Its
- It's

Ah well, see you later! ðŸ‘‹

(I totally did not copy the example they give you)
