### Hi, I am \[Cursors\]

#### I am pursuing fullstack, and love to dabble in discord.js on the side.

I'm apart of [AeroWare](https://github.com/aero-ware/) and I love to make original things there.

I can be found on Discord as `[Cursors]#9257` and I lurk around in AeroWare, The Coding Den, Worn Off Keys, and MenuDocs.

*For my main course, I will have TypeScript.*

*On the side, I can have some React and Next.*

*I guess Express will be good as an appetizer.*

*Mongo and mongoose for desert sounds wonderful as well.*
